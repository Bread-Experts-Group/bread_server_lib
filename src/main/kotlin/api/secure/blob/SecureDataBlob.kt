/**
 * [SecureDataBlob]s allow the secure storage of data in-memory by encrypting / decrypting it during use.
 * Certain operating systems (such as Windows) may allow you to control who can decrypt the data at a time, such as
 * a remote process, or using the local user account. [SecureDataBlob]s must be initialized through a feature in
 * [SecureDataBlobFeatures]. It is not possible to re-initialize a [SecureDataBlob] after it has been cleaned up.
 *
 * [SecureDataBlob]s cannot be written to disk, and their contents will be lost if the computer loses power. It is not
 * advised that you store data for a long time in [SecureDataBlob]s.
